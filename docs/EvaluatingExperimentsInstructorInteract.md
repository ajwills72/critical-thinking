Main points are:

- Correlations are weak evidence of cause

- Longitudinal designs do not establish cause

- Experiments can establish cause

   - Compare two conditions
   - Two conditions should only differ in variable of interest, nothing else
   - "Anything else" is a confound (see also ED1 workshop)
- Experimental design is hard

   - pre-existing differences (see also ED1 workshop)
   - attrition
   - expectancy effects (participant and experimenter) - blinding & pre-pregistration
   - order effects
   
- Non-directional hypotheses are weak
