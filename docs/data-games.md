# Data games - Instructor notes

## Farm race game (Normal distribution)

### What is it?

Activity to demonstrate where the normal distribution comes from. Also revises
basic histogram plotting and the idea of a distribution.

### What do they do?

Students form groups by proximity / breakout rooms. Each size / makeup of
groups doesn't matter, but no more than eight groups, and they should be of
roughly equal size.

Each student has a laptop, on which they have gone to
[rolladie.net](https://rolladie.net) , set it up for rolling 4 six-sided
dice. They also go to [menti.com](https://www.menti.com) and enter the code
provided.

The class leader shows the [farm race slide](data-games.odp), and the
mentimeter poll results - [example layout](race-poll.png). Groups pick their
animal in turn. When all on starting line, TA picks a student from each group
in turn to roll dice, report score, and answer menti poll. Class leader moves
corresponding animal that distance in cm (see rule).

First team over the line wins! There should be some kind of prize.

### What data do we end up with?

Average throw is 4 * 3.5 = 14, so the average group will finish in 8
throws. With 6 groups, the likelihood is one will win more quickly, roughly 7
on average I think. So the group will end up with around 40 tally marks on the
sheet, which should be just about enough to show a normal-like
distribution. We'll use this data in the mini-tutorial below.

### End-of-exercise mini-tutorial

Gather the groups together. Ask students whether any one number on a
single fair dice is more likely than any other (it isn't). Show them a
likely tally chart for a single dice on this basis. Ask them to
compare this with the tally chart for their horse race scores. How are
they different? Why are they different?  (They're different because
there's only one way to get 24 or 4, but a lot of different ways to
get middling sums). Make the point that when any number is the sum (or
mean) of a bunch of different numbers, the sum will have approximately
this distribution --- *whatever the distribution of the individual
scores*. This is why a lot of data relating to people has a normal
distribution. For example, IQ scores are made up of scores on a lot of
different tests, and the resulting average is normally distributed (in
the non-brain-damaged population).
