# Are there replications of Ludmer et al. (2011)

As of 5th October 2021, this paper had 130 citations on Google Scholar.

- 18 were not in English

- 13 were reviews or theory articles rather than original data

- 10 were not published scientific articles

- 3 were with a species other than humans

- 1 paper appeared twice. 

This left 85 published articles that needed closer examination. 

## Not on the neuroscience of the aha! effect

53 of the remaining articles did not report fMRI data so could not be a replication, and 3 had fMRI data but were not on the aha! effect, so we're down to 29 articles. 

## Not a direct replication

Just because a study shows amygdala activation, or studies the aha! phenomenon, that doessn't necessarily mean it's a replication. It also needs to observe the substantially same result as Ludmer, i.e. that the activation of the amygdala correlates with later memory of the stimulus in an aha! procedure. 

From my reading, no published article is a direct replication of Ludmer et al. (2011) in this sense. 

## Some examples

Here are some papers that students sometimes identify as replications, but aren't. Compiled from two student so far.

### Review article

- Shen et al. (2018, Biological Psychology) - a review article.

### Not a neuroscience study

- Kizilirmak et al. (2015, Psychological Research)

- Shen et al. (2016, British Journal of Psychology)

- Ishikawa et al. (2019, Frontiers in Psychology) 

### Not a direct replication

- Kozunov et al. (2020, NeuroImage) - For example, it does not report activity of amygdala, does not assess correlation of memory with brain activity.
