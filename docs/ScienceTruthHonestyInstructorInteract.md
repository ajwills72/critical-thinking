## Poll 2: Subjective versus objective claims

Poll items:

- Too vague: Fried food is bad

- OK, bizarre : There is a tiny dragon inside my laptop

- OK, prosaic: Donald Trump's IQ is greater than 100 

- Simply not objective: I am a very stable genius

## Activity 1: Scientific claims

Some examples I came up with:

Developmental - "As a baby, most of my dreams were about my mother" (0/6)
- subjective, descriptive, context-dependent, not measurable, not replicable, not falsifiable

Clinical- "Anxious people should avoid loud noises" (2/6)
- objective, prescriptive, context-indepedent, not fully measurable "anxious people", prescriptive nature makes it hard to independently replicate, prescriptive nature makes it hard to falsify

Neuroscience - "Any given neuron in this person's brain is either excitatory or
inhibitory, but not both" - - All but appropriately context-independent

## Activity 2: Does it replicate?

Paper is from a recent lecture. I checked the first 30 or so, only found these
that were even close:

Huang et al. (2018) "Neural correlates of novelty and appropriateness
processing in externally induced constraint relaxation" - Amygdala reaction is
not to novelty, but to appropriateness. So emotional response to problem
solving, not to an aha! effect specifically.

Gonzalez-Garcia et al. (2018) "Content-specific activity in frontoparietal and
default-mode networks during prior- guided visual perception" - Did not show
amygdala reaction
