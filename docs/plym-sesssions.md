# Session plan for Plymouth University delivery

## R session 1

### Preparation 

- Set up zoom pre-meetings.

- Set up zoom meetings using CSV lists of tutorial groups.

- Ensure everyone is on Teams 

### Session

1.30pm - Open teams plus pre-meeting zoom. TAs arrive when possible.

2.00pm - Start main zoom session.

2.05pm - Intro to session: 

- topics: learning data analysis in R.

- running through DLE worksheets in order in breakout groups for most of session.

- working in groups to provide peer support. If you get it, and someone in your group doesn't, please take the time to explain it to them. If none of you get it, ask for help. 

- We have many skilled people on hand to help you - just click 'ask for help' in your breakout room, and I'll assign someone to help your group. 

- Read the every sentence of the worksheets slowly, clearly, and in order. Don't try to skip ahead, this is the most common reason students get stuck or misunderstand.

- We'll return from breakout rooms for a very brief lecture and Q&A at 3pm. At that point you should have everything you need to complete the Psyc:EL activity. Make sure you complete this.

- Bring your data to the next R workshop Thursday. We're going to analyze it. So, of course, you need to have finished collection before then. You also need to have worked out your scores, such that you have just a single number for each person you have tested. You'll need to do all that _before_ the session, because you'll need to full two-hours for everything else. 

2.15pm - Put into breakout rooms.

3.00pm - Return to main room. Mean/median lecture. Q&A

3.15pm - Back to breakout rooms. 

3.50pm - Return to main room, finish up. Re-iterate:

- Psych:EL
- Bring data!

3.55pm - Finish!

4.00pm - Rinse and repeat.
