## Experiment Evaluation activity (15 min)

- There's an example answer [here](mueller-checklist.html)

- I need to start with poll and feedback on the Experiment Evaluation activity (last session)

- Collect each of component scores via poll, and total scores, all in one go. (5 min)

- Then talk through my take on this study, take questions/comments as I go. (10 min)

## Spot the weak argument (25 min)

- 6 examples, one for each type. 

- Group to decide which is which (15 min)

- Return to take poll (5 min)

- Give answers (5 min)

## Fox-hunting activity (20 min)

They can evaluate this argument using the flowchart. It took me 5 minutes non-interactive, so at least 10 minutes from them to do it. Let's say 15 min to be sure. Plus 5 minutes for me to feedback.
