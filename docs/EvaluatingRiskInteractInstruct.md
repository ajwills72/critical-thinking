## Probability excercises

Exercise 1: Dice: 0.17 (1 in 6); Bus: 0.33 (1 in 3). 

Exercise 2:

- Probability of dying during 2022, across everyone living in England or Wales
  (about 0.5%)

- Probability of getting 4 numbers in the next Lotto game if you buy one ticket
  (about 0.1%)

- Probability of committing suicide during 2022 if you live in England/Wales,
  and are aged 5-34 (about 0.005% -- about 34% of the population in this age
  range, so about 20 million. About 1000 deaths by suicide in this group
  annually, so about .005%).

## Monty Hall game

There are some slides to live-demonstrate the Monty Hall problem [here](monty-hall.odp)
