# Data management workshop (Instructor's notes)

_Andy J. Wills_

This online lecture is based around the [data management](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr) worksheet of the RMINR materials. The first half-hour is getting going, and me doing a talk through with slides (not yet made) of the talky bits on that worksheet. The remainder is supported working through that worksheet.

Assessment: Set up the private repository for your dissertation, add at least one relevant file, and use github to share it with me. Once you've done that, screenshot the front page of your github repository on https://github.com, convert that screenshot to a PDF, and upload the PDF to PsycEL.
