# TARA / PTT support for PSYC411: Workshops 7, 8, 9

## Where?

Link 301

## When?

Complicated. There are 9 people supporting these 3 workshops, but only
4 people at any given time. See this [list](staffing.csv) for when I
am expecting to see you in Link 301.

## What?

Three two-hour workshops, on basic concepts in statistics and on how
to use RStudio. More specifically...

### Workshop 7

- Distributions and samples (_1 hour_):
   [slides](distributions-samples.pdf),
   [instructor notes](distributions-samples.html)

## Preparation?

It seems unlikely we would find a time where all 10 of us are free at
the same time for a pre-meeting. So, instead, please spend your prep
time looking through the materials for the workshops you will be
supporting. If you have questions, my availability is on outlook, so
send me a meeting request for a time I am free. If you are able to
come see me in groups larger than one to ask these questions, so much
the better :-)
