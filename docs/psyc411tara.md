# TARA / PTT support for PSYC411 workshops in Week 3

## Where, when, what?

**Where**: Link 301 

**When**: See WAM for your times.

**What**: Three two-hour workshops, on basic concepts in statistics and on how
to use RStudio. 

## Preparation

It seems unlikely we would find a time where all 10 of us are free at the same
time for a pre-meeting. So, instead, please spend your prep time looking
through the materials for the workshops you will be supporting, links provided
below. If you have questions, come to my [office hours](https://dle.plymouth.ac.uk/mod/scheduler/view.php?id=1181642).  If you are
able to come see me in groups larger than one to ask these questions, so much
the better :-)

## Content

For those of you who supported these workshops in 2018 or 2019, we're back to
that format, with some minor tweaks. For those who supported in 2020, it's
basically the same material, but the ordering is different and a few things are
more physical.

For all of you, here's all the materials we'll use this year:

### Workshop 1

- Distributions and samples:
