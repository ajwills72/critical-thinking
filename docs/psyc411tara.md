# TARA / PTT support for PSYC411 workshops: One data games, two R.

## Where?

Link 301 / Online.

## When?

Complicated. There are 10 people supporting these 3 workshops, but only at most
5 people at any given time. See this [list](staffing.csv) for when I am
expecting to see you.

## What?

Three two-hour workshops, on basic concepts in statistics and on how
to use RStudio. More specifically...

### Data games

- [slides](data-games-slides.pdf)
- [instructor notes](data-games.html)

### R workshop 1

- [worksheet 1](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/intro-rstudio.html),
- [worksheet 2](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/exploring-incomes.html)
- [worksheet 3](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/group-differences.html)

### R workshop 2

- [worksheet 5](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/using-projects.html)

## Preparation?

It seems unlikely we would find a time where all 10 of us are free at
the same time for a pre-meeting. So, instead, please spend your prep
time looking through the materials for the workshops you will be
supporting. If you have questions, my availability is on outlook, so
send me a meeting request for a time I am free. If you are able to
come see me in groups larger than one to ask these questions, so much
the better :-)
