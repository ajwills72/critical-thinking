# Science, truth, and honesty 
_Andy Wills_

This lecture series starts by considering two fundamental questions
---  'what is truth?' and 'what is science?'. We start with the
nature of truth.

## Truth as a property of claims

It's not possible to get anywhere if one considers truth as some kind
of general ineffable property of the universe. Truth is, at heart, one
property of a claim. Someone makes a claim and someone (the same
person, or someone else) attributes the property 'true' to it. Or
the property 'not true' (false). It is also possible to attribute
some level of belief, perhaps using probability. Finally, it is
possible to 'opt out' and say you have insufficient information to
make a sensible judgement.

## Subjective and objective claims 

Truth is a property of claims, but there are different types of claims
--- a recurring theme in this lecture. The first distinction we need
to make is between subjective and objective claims.

Subjective claims are those whose truth differs for different
people. So, for example, the truth of the statement 'My favourite
colour is blue' differs depending upon who says it. Objective claims
are those whose truth value is not affected by who says
it. 'Charlotte Smith's favourite colour is blue'. This is true, or
false, irrespective of whether I say it, you say it, or Charlotte
Smith says it.

Note that the term 'subjective' is among the most widely mis-used,
particularly when referring to psychology. For example, the claim 'I
think chocolate tastes better than cabbage' is subjective, but the
claim 'chocolate tastes better than cabbage' is objective, and is
amenable to scientific test (for example, taste ratings taken over a
representative sample of individuals).

## Vague claims are subjective

Critically, a claim is not objective if it is too vague to be
tested. For example, 'smoking is wrong' - not objective because
'wrong' has a number of different meanings.

## Scientific claims

At its heart, science is the process of making scientific claims and then
attempting to determine whether those claims are true or false. Scientific
claims are objective rather than subjective, see earlier. Science also limits,
or should limit, the claims that it makes to those whose truth or falsity can,
at least in principle, be clearly determined.

In general, this means scientific claims are descriptive rather than
prescriptive.

## Descriptive versus prescriptive claims

Science's focus on descriptive claims does not exempt scientists from
having moral or ethical principles, or from wanting to change the
world in particular ways. But scientists choose to investigate the
issues inherent in prescriptive claims by converting them to
descriptive claims that are relevant to the prescriptive point.

For example, a scientist who wishes to make the claim 'abortion
should be made illegal' looks for a descriptive claim that would
support the prescriptive claim. For example, if one wished to support
the outlawing of abortion, one might make the claim 'feotal pain
receptors have developed by eight weeks gestation', in order to
support your prescriptive claim. If one wished to argue against that
prescriptive claim, you might then make the descriptive claim
'foetal pain receptors are not connected to the brain until at least
20 weeks'.

Similarly, in order to support the prescriptive claim about
drink-driving, you would make some kind of descriptive claim. For
example, 'Risk of car accidents doubles at 80mg/100ml blood alcohol
(UK drink-driving limit)'

So, science is not about avoiding societally difficult questions. It
is about making claims that can be reliably examined, in order to help
answer difficult questions.

## Absolute versus contextual claims

To summarize, scientific claims are objective, and they are usually
descriptive. However, scientific claims are seldom absolute.

Absolute claims are invariant. They hold always. Their truth value is
not conditional on circumstances. They are not conditional on time or
place.

Contextual claims hold under a defined set of conditions. Scientists should
define those conditions, but do not always do this. For example, consider the
claim, 'the leadership positions that women occupy are less promising than
those of their male counterparts'. This is not intended to be an absolute
claim. It is, rather, a claim about a current state of affairs. If this claim
is true now, but no longer true in 20 years, perhaps due to increased awareness
of the issue, this does not undermine the truth value of the original claim --
as long as it is seen in the appropriate context.

In general, scientists wish to investigate claims that are, as far as
possible, context independent. In other words, as close to being
absolute claims as is achievable. Indeed, it is hard to think of
claims as scientific in the broader sense if they are too
context-specific.  For example:

'The leadership positions that women in 2003 in UK FTSE100 companies
occupy are less promising than those of their male counterparts'

Such a claim is technically scientific, but the truth being claimed is
so contextual that it is not possible to, for example, make any
further predictions.

## Scientific claims and truth

Scientific claims are objective, descriptive, and relatively context
independent. They also have a number of other properties. First, some
scientific claims are true and others are false. A claim that is false
can still be scientific if it meets the other criteria.

## Observable, measurable states

Second, scientific claims are based on observable, measurable
states. Making sure your claim is descriptive rather than prescriptive
helps to make it observable and measurable, but doesn't always get you
all the way there. For example, consider the claim 'impulsive people
are more likely to be criminals'. Being a criminal is a state that is
observable and measurable in a number of relatively uncontroversial
ways. For example, if you have been convicted of a crime then you are
a criminal in an observable and measurable way.

Impulsivity is a fairly vague concept that has to be somehow
translated into something directly measurable. One of the
contributions of modern psychology has been to develop explicit
measures that can be clearly assessed for reliability and validity. In
the case of impulsivity, there is a 30-item standard questionnaire
called the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS). So, our claim becomes:

'People with one or more criminal convictions score higher on the BIS
than people without a conviction'

## Independent replication

Third, scientific claims must be expressed in such a way that they
permit independent replication. For example, claiming that Willsian
Therapy reduces depression is not a scientific claim if Wills is the
only person who can perform Willsian Therapy.

## Scientific claims

Finally, scientific claims have to be falsifiable. This basically
means that it must be possible to imagine an outcome of an experiment
or other study that would lead to the conclusion the claim was
false. If this is not possible, the claim is unfalsifiable and hence
unscientific. Note the difference between falsifiable (one can imagine
a set of circumstances in which it could be shown to be wrong), and
falsified (one has demonstrated that it is wrong). Good, productive,
science consists of the collection of claims that are falsifiable but
not (yet) falsified.

## Science and dishonesty

To summarize, science is about making scientific claims, and we've
looked at what makes a claim scientific (or unscientific). But
science, like all human endeavours, is about more than this. It is
also about being part of a culture that holds certain behaviours and
processes in high regard. Transgressing these rules leads to the normal
cultural sanctions --- isolation, exclusion and, sometimes,
expulsion. In some cases, these cultural aspects represent A WAY of
doing science, rather than THE ONLY WAY it could be done.
		
The first cultural norm of modern science is honesty. This is most easily
defined by its opposite --- dishonesty. It is dishonest to partially report
your results if your intention is to obscure results that are inconsistent with
your claim. It is dishonest to choose a form of data analysis because it gives
you the result you want. It is dishonest to publish the same data more than
once without acknowledging you have done this. And it is dishonest to say you
collected some data when actually you just made it up!
		
The reason honesty is such an important cultural norm in science is
that dishonesty gets in the way of reliably evaluating claims, and wastes
peoples' time. Science is a highly social cooperative activity.

## Failures to replicate

Another important cultural norm in science is scepticism. Scientists
should welcome it when others are skeptical about their claims,
because such scepticism can lead to close examination of the evidence,
which in turn advances our understanding. Essentially, being
scientific is about soliciting and welcoming criticism. This is
something that many of us, including me, still find emotionally quite
difficult.

One recent development in scepticism is the increasing emphasis on not
only scientific claims permitting independent replication, but the
importance that such independent replication is actually
conducted. Recent meta-analyses suggest that a half to two-thirds of
results in psychology fail to replicate. 


# Further materials

The following information is relevant to the topic of the lecture, but was not
discussed within it. Reading to the end should broaden and deepen your
understanding of the topics we covered.

## Relativism

When one asks 'what is truth?', one generally is asking what it
means to say that an objective claim is true. One possibility is to
avoid the question by asserting that there are no objective claims --
all claims are subjective and hence the truth value of all claims
depends on who is speaking them.

This position about truth is called relativism. It's not an uncommon
view, even amongst academics, but it's pretty problematic.

First, any definition of relativism is self-defeating. For example,
relativism is the belief that 'all truth is relative'. This claim
is, in itself, universal and so proves that not all truth is relative!
The same problem exists for expressions such as 'No one can say what
is right or wrong'.

Another real problem with relativism is that it seems to preclude the
possibility of being wrong. If truth is simply what you believe, then your
beliefs cannot be in error (they can however be incoherent, see below).

One can avoid these paradoxes by saying, for example 'some truth is
relative'. This seems undeniably true, but it still leaves us with the
question - what does it mean to say an objective claim is true?

## Correspondence and coherence

The answer is really quite prosaic. Truth can be defined both in terms
of correspondence and coherence. Anyone who has ever watched a crime
programme on TV knows this.

Correspondence Theory states that Truth is determined by the
correspondence between what is claimed and what is observed. An murder
suspect claims to have been at home between 10pm and midnight, but he
was seen by a reliable witness some miles from his house at that
time. The murder suspect's objective claim is judged to be false
because it does not correspond to observations.

Coherence Theory states that Truth is determined by the coherence
between new claims and other justified claims. The Defence claims that
the apparent murder victim actually committed suicide. A number of
Prosecution witnesses testify that the victim had no history of
depression or other mental illness, and appeared happy in the days and
weeks leading up the attack. The Defence's claim seems unlikely to be
true, not on the basis of anyone having observed how the injuries were
inflicted, but on the lack of coherence between this claim and other
justified claims.


## Open-access publication

Science is highly social and cooperative. Collecting data, and evaluating
claims, and then keeping the results of that evaluation to yourself is
generally frowned upon.  There are two important recent developments that have
emerged from this belief in the importance of publication.

The first is a realisation that the traditional method of academic publishing
is getting in the way of the reasons we should be publishing in the first
place. Generally, scientists publish in scientific journals. Subscriptions to
these journals cost thousands of pounds a year, and are generally only held in
university libraries, which are often not open to the public.

The solution is open-access publishing. This means making your publications
freely available at no charge. There are a number of ways to achieve this. For
example, every scientific paper I have ever written is available for free
download from [my website](https://www.andywills.info).

The second recent development related to publication is the realisation that
the internet now permits scientists to make not only their publications, but
also their raw data, freely, publicly, and permanently available. This is
really incredibly important. It is one thing to run a study again because you
want to independently replicate it. It is quite another to have to run it again
because the original author didn't analyse the data properly and the raw data
no longer exists.
